# ML_Binary_Classifier
ML Program to Train and create a Binary Classifier Model. Make sure to train them on your own LABELLED Dataset

Getting the perfect Dataset is a huge challenge and also figuring out the dependancies to run the ML trainer.

I would recommend to use conda environment and install packages using conda (avoid using pip)
